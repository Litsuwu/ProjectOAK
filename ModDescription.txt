[h1]Hearts of Oak[/h1]

[b]Compatible with version 1.6.0 - Man the Guns[/b]

[h1]Overview:[/h1]

Hearts of Oak is a total overhaul mod that aims to provide a more complete and balanced World War 2 experience, without overcomplicating or compromising balance. The AI has been improved in many areas and extra challenges have been added for the player.

The mod is intended for both singleplayer and multiplayer, featuring playability improvements that focus on the player's experience against other players. It strives to provide great gameplay, within the rich history of the Second World War.

Hearts of Oak includes unique tech trees, focus trees, designers, and advisors for all majors, and important minors, to ensure you are immersed playing your country of choice. Moreover focus trees can last late into the war, and units on the field are precious, as the industrial capacity of a nation takes time to develop.
