A few agents of the NKVD moved always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating any individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party. It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice. It was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance."

 soviet.121.t:0 "Long May Our Crimson Flag Inspire"
 soviet.121.d:0 "The fashist were brave indeed for thinking they could march into the very heart of our Motherland and get away with it. It was as if knowing that they were fighting for what would be the ultimate last effort, a great strength befell the army. Was it self-belief? Supernatural? Self-preservation? We will never know, either way, we fought for the future, will destroy the invader and long shall we be united and free!"

 soviet.122.t:0 "The Heart of the Motherland has Stoppped"
 soviet.122.d:0 "The heart which has kept this great nation going has fallen silent. A great chill descends upon all comrades of the USSR. Stalin and the rest of the Politburo is no where to be seen. The high command? Gone. Everything is just gone. The last hope in the world has gone. We have lost, and with it, the world has now lost. The world is now about to plunge into an uncertain future, one possible devoid of anything as the fashist boot cruelly oppresses any attempt to stand up to them. Failure was not an option and yet somehow it happened anyway. "

 soviet.123.d:0 "The siege of Leningrad has been one of unparalleled brutality and hardship. Stranded between our Finnish enemies and the German fashist, there was no escape for anyone. The only way out of hell, was through it, and that was exactly what you did. You lifted that terrible siege and showed those bastards that even in our darkest hour, the city which bears the name of the great Lenin, will never break, not to filthy monarchists or monstrous fascists. "
 soviet.123.a:0 "Death to the Invaders!"

 soviet.124.t:0 "A Moment of Silence, Shrouded in Darkness, "
 soviet.124.d:0 "The harsh cold of a Baltic winter is creeping in, bodies line the streets, their faces contorted with unimageable expressions of horror. This ancient city will become nothing more than a ruin, haunted by those who died attempting to hold it. Their wailing echoing throughout for all time. A reminder of what price failure is met with, a reminder that sometimes, some things are better left forgotten for their memory is too painful to recollect."

 soviet.125.t:0 "The Fortress City Stands Triumphant"
 soviet.125.d:0 "Through the suffering, death and destruction, our brave comrades have succeeded in repelling the fashist from this glorious city which bears our great leader’s name. Now, however, is not the time for celebration, it is not the time for rest, it is not the time to dwell on those we have lost. Now it is the time to push, harder and more ferociously than ever before. We WILL drive the Nazi bastards back to where the pizda himself sits on his throne of skulls and anguish."

 soviet.126.t:0 "Nothing but Rubble on the Volga"
 soviet.126.d:0 "Despite seemingly giving everything we could have possibly given, it wasn’t enough. There is nothing left for us beyond the Volga. Stalingrad has fallen, Russia has fallen. All the blood and sacrifice up until this point has all been for nothing. The fashist will march through this sacred city, defiling the very foundations with every step taken. Any survivors left in the city will have no mercy from those bastards. The screams of women and children will echo throughout the Motherland, and you failed in preventing it."
