The meeting marked the radicalisation of Hitler's foreign policies. \n\nAccording to the Memorandum, Hitler did not want war with Britain and France in 1939. Instead he wanted small wars of plunder to help support Germany's struggling economy. The meeting was named after Hitler's military adjutant, Colonel Count Friedrich Hossbach who recorded the minutes of the meeting. \n\nBesides Hitler and Hossbach the meeting was attended by Baron Konstantin von Neurath (Foreign Minister), Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg (War Minister), General Werner von Fritsch (Army Commander), Admiral Erich Raeder (Kriegsmarine Commander) and Hermann Göring (Luftwaffe Commander)."

 news.2242.d:0 "The Blomberg-Fritsch Affair were two related scandals in early 1938 that resulted in the subjugation of the German Armed Forces by Hitler. The affair started after the marriage of War Minister Werner von Blomberg to Erna Gruhn in January 1938. Berlin police discovered she had a long criminal record and had posed for pornographic photographs. Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage to avoid a scandal and to preserve the Armys integrity. Blomberg initially refused, and it was only after Hermann Göring threatened to make his wife's past public knowledge that he resigned. \n\n Göring did not want Werner von Fritsch to become Blomberg’s successor and therefore his boss. Heinrich Himmler wanted to weaken the Army to strengthen his Schutzstaffel as a competitor to it.  Reinhard Heydrich prepared a file on von Fritsch alleging homosexuality. Fritsch resigned on 4 February 1938."

 news.2244.d:0 "Modern Times is a comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin in 1936. His iconic 'Little Tramp' character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the 'Great Depression'. Chaplin felt that those conditions were created by the efficiencies of modern industrialization. \n\nChaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first talkie and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of the Tramp would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen."

Schmeling had studied Louis' style, and in the days before the fight, he claimed to have found the key to victory however many commentators thought that he was just trying to raise interest in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion. \n\nAs rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling's jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible. \n\nBy round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan.

The term eventually became the standard designation for all intelligence from high-level cryptanalytic sources.  The name arose because the code-breaking was considered more important than the highest security classification available at the time, (Most Secret), and so was regarded as being Ultra secret.  Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, hence the term Ultra has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts".  The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is credited with having provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort and with having shortened the war, though Ultra's precise influence is still being studied and debated.

The British used this information as the foundation for their own early efforts to decrypt Enigma.  The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire "shooting party" was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages. These proved too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections."

Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking messages enciphered on the German Enigma machine, but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been the breaking of the German Fish High Command teleprinter cyphers.

Meanwhile, the Conservatives were pressuring King to advise that the Governor General introduce overseas conscription. In April 1942 a plebiscite was held on the question, "Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligations arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service?"\n\nThe plebiscite was supported by most English Canadians as well as the banned Communist Party of Canada which established Tim Buck "Yes" Committees to campaign for a yes vote. Across Canada, 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Even in Toronto, a strongly pro-conscription region, Conservative Arthur Meighen was defeated in a by-election after promising to help introduce conscription."

From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.  In November 1933, the name was changed to Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors. LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old Reich Chancellery and the new Reich Chancellery.[74] The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events.

From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.  In November 1933, the name was changed to Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors. LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old Reich Chancellery and the new Reich Chancellery.[74] The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events.

 ss_event.667.d:0 "The SS-Totenkopfverbände was closely associated with Germany's concentration camp system. On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed SS-Oberführer Theodor Eicke as commandant of Dachau concentration camp, one of the first National socialist concentration camps. It was created to consolidate the many small camps that had been set up by various police agencies and the NSDAP to house political prisoners. The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later concentration camps. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the concentration camps under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the "Death's Head Units", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major concentration camps. Leadership at the camps was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional camps.[92] Six concentration camps[a] housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939. By the end of the war, hundreds of camps of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people, most of whom were targeted by the regime because of their race. The concentration camp population rose in tandem with the defeats suffered by the National socialist government; the worse the catastrophe seemed, the greater the fear of subversion, prompting the SS to intensify their repression and terror."

Each regiment would contain three battalions, a motorcycle company and mortar company.\nThe existence of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT) was publicly declared on 16 March 1935 by Hitler in a speech at the Reichstag. The SS-VT had to depend on the German Army for its supply of weapons and military training, and they had control of the recruiting system through local draft boards responsible for assigning conscripts to the different branches of the Wehrmacht to meet quotas set by the German High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or OKW in German).

Recruits were required to have perfect teeth and eyesight and provide a medical certificate. By 1938 the height restrictions were relaxed, up to six dental fillings were permitted, and eyeglasses for astigmatism and mild vision correction were allowed. Once World War II in Europe commenced, the physical requirements were no longer strictly enforced, and essentially any recruit who could pass a basic medical exam was considered for Waffen-SS service. Following the campaign in the West in 1940, Hitler authorized the enlistment of "people perceived to be of related stock", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks. A number of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns volunteered to fight in the Waffen-SS under the command of German officers. Non-Germanic units such as the Indische Tiger Legion and the Azad Hind Legion were not considered to be part of the SS directly, which still maintained its strict racial criteria, but rather were considered to be foreign nationals serving under the command of the SS."

Royal assent given on 5 September 1939.\n\nThe Act established a National Register which began operating on 29 September 1939 (National Registration Day), a system of identity cards, and a requirement that they must be produced on demand or presented to a police station within 48 hours.\n\nThree main reasons for their introduction:\n\n1. The major dislocation of the population caused by mobilisation and mass evacuation and also the wartime need for complete manpower control and planning in order to maximise the efficiency of the war economy.\n\n2. The likelihood of rationing (introduced from January 1940 onwards).\n\n3. Population statistics. As the last census had been held in 1931, there was little accurate data on which to base vital planning decisions. The National Register was in fact an instant census and the National Registration Act closely resembles the 1920 Census Act in many ways."

 kns.2.t:0 "End of Japanese Civil War"
 kns.2.d_f:0 "Despite numerous guerilla warfare and popular supports, the democratic supporters had been defeated in the Japanese civil war. All suspects were detained or executed. In order to stablize the situation, Emperor Hirohito gave a speech to the Japanese public stated that war is their only destiny. However, the crowd's response stated otherwise."
 kns.2.d_d:0 "After hours of assault to the emperor's bunker, the fascist regime surrendered to the democratic supporters. Having won the civil war, the democratic cabinet is now trying to mend the wounds caused by the former fascist regime. 'We do not hope to be forgiven, but we will do our part nonetheless.' said one of the Japanese democratic revolutionaries."
 kns.2.a:0 "Hope the Japanese know what they are doing..."
 kns.3.t:0 "Fall Of Beijing"
 kns.3.d:0 "After a failed raid of the Japanese frontline HQ, the Chinese suffered enormous casualties. In order to prevent further casualties, the Chinese commander has ordered the troops to retreat out of Beijing. The Japanese Army later marched into the city with minimal resistence.\n\nThe Forbidden Palace has reported to have some artefacts removed by the Japanese. Fortunately most of it was evacuated back in 1933 to the south, so the Japanese were only able to remove a few large bronze tubs and a few pieces of cannon."

The troublesome aspect is that not only did Quebéc vote no, they voted nearly 73% against it. It is very likely that things will not change in Quebec in terms of conscription. Perhaps in light of what their peers have said they will change their minds, even if just a little. Of course we could be more forceful instead."

When an angry mob approached the bases instead of fighting they instead were told to stand down by local officers, citing that it should be the will of the people to decide their own fate. As a result the garrisons were allowed to leave safely and forthright Newfoundland and Labrador belong to us."
 better_canada.5.a:0 "Just as planned"
 better_canada.6.d:0 "Earlier this morning locals of Newfoundland and Labrador were incited to a mob and marched onto the various garrison bases demanding their independence from [ENG.GetName]. The officers, fearing a senseless bloodshed, gave in to their demands and the [ENG.GetNameDef] troops were allowed to leave peacefully. There are already whispers that this was far too coordinated to have simply have been a 'random' set of mobs and accusations have been already levied towards [CAN.GetName] as being the likely culprit."

 better_canada.7.d:0 "Earlier today the various fascist parties of Canada held a national convention in Kingston, Ontario. There it was decided to unite all of the parties into one new party led by a particularily charismatic person called 'Adrien Arcand'. As his first action of this newly unified party Arcand held a rally at Massey Hall to promote the party.

startevent.2.d:0 "Japan is one of the major Axis-aligned nations in the game. Generally, we can say Japan faces significant resource limitations, especially for oil and rubber. These can be mitigated through aggressive expansion, either north into the USSR or south into China and Southeast Asia. Japan has an impressively-sized navy but has relatively weak naval production capacity. The army is mostly infantry-based and Japan will struggle to keep up with Western armor technology. More information is available to read in each tab."

startevent.3.t:0 "Empire of Japan - History"
startevent.3.d:0 "Imperial Japan's rapid industrialization and militarization led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire. Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism, eventually culminating in Japan's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific region. In 1931, Japan invaded and conquered the Northeast China / Manchuria, with little resistance. Japan invaded China proper in 1937, creating what was essentially a three-way war between Japan, Mao Zedong's communists, and Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists.\n In late 1941, Japan's government, led by Prime Minister and General Hideki Tojo, decided to break the US-led embargo through force of arms. In the early stages of the war, Japan scored victory after victory. The tide began to turn against Japan following the Battle of Midway in June 1942 and the subsequent Battle of Guadalcanal, in which Allied troops wrested the Solomon Islands from Japanese control. on August 6, 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb over Hiroshima, killing over 90,000 people. The unconditional surrender of Japan was announced by Emperor Hirohito on August 14."
startevent.4.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Army"
startevent.4.b:0 "Tell me more about the technologies"
startevent.4.d:0 "Imperial Japan has a relatively small number of operational divisions at game start. Infantry divisions are mostly overstrength; 15 divisions are in either a 3x5 or 4x5 pattern, meaning the divisions are around twice as large as comparable 3x3 regimented divisions. Making these divisions smaller may prove useful in the dispersed, low-infrastructure areas Japan will likely be invading. Japan's 3 mixed infantry divisions and 9 cavalry divisions can serve as a basis for either a light secondary infantry force, or can be motorized / mechanized later on. Japan has 2 motorized divisions which are quite developed. Japan's armor is lacking, with only 2 small brigade-sized groupings, and will require substantial investment to improve. Japan also has 30 garrison divisions, mostly stationed in the Pacific islands. These can be either disbanded or retooled to defend other areas, depending on your priorities."
startevent.5.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Navy"
startevent.5.d:0 "Imperial Japan starts with one of the most impressive navies in the game, only outclassed by the USA and UK. Japan starts with 2 relatively modern aircraft carriers and 2 light aircraft carriers, which form a healthy baseline from which to build a larger, dispersed carrier fleet. Japan has 6 battleships and 4 battlecruisers completed at start, which are all fairly modern. Japan also has considerable numbers of medium-sized ships: 17 heavy cruisers and 19 light cruisers of varying age. Japan has 92 screening ships at game start, which are similarly split between modern and interwar. The submarine fleet of 52 is large but somewhat out of date. Japan's initial production queue has 2 carriers, 4 heavy cruisers, 13 destroyers, and 7 submarines. The player can choose whether to prioritize capital ships over a raiding fleet, or if Japan should focus more resources on battleships as opposed to fleet carriers. Ultimately, Japan's biggest naval weakness is its difficulty rebuilding its fleet due to its output to fleet size ratio."
startevent.6.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Airforce"
startevent.6.d:0 "Japan's airforce is quite unique. The IJA and IJN both competed for power and influence in the Japanese state, and operated almost totally independently in many cases. This can be seen in their air developments - both branches had separate planes which they used. Most of the IJN airforce in 1936 was located in Taiwan, with about around 900 planes, most of which are naval bombers, short-range fighters and close air support. The IJA airforce was split between Manchuria and the Home Islands, with about 850 aircraft, again mostly short-range fighters and close air support, with some medium bombers. While Japan does have good short-range planes, it will need a significant investment of research in order to develop longer-range bombers or fighters - and if you are playing historical, you will need to double this, as both military branches will require separate technology investment."
startevent.7.t:0 "Empire of Japan - Strategy"
startevent.7.d:0 "Japan's lack of material resources and existing military adventures in East Asia will make your first priority the subjugation of China, which has tremendous manpower and good amounts of natural resources to exploit. After this, Japan is presented with two equally difficult options: to either strike north into the USSR using land forces, or to strike south using naval forces. Japan's productive capacity will limit its ability to do both simultaneously and so only one should be considered. Going north will require building up Manchurian infrastructure and Japan's lacking armored forces, while going south will require additional naval invasion forces and using natural resources for the Imperial Japanese Navy."

 blackicenavalevents.1.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Hiryū-class aircraft carrier. The IJN Sōryū ("Blue Dragon") and IJN Hiryū ("Flying Dragon") were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armored. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations. These were the first modern aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the platform further aircraft carrier development was based on."

Completed shortly before the start of the Pacific War in 1941, they have been called "arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world" when built. The Shōkaku-class carriers were initially intended to have an air group of 96, including 24 aircraft in reserve. All of these aircraft were either superseded by larger, more modern aircraft or cancelled while the ships were being built, so the air group was revised for a totla of 84 aircraft."

 blackicenavalevents.3.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Shinano-class aircraft carrier. The IJN Shinano was laid down as one of the three Yamato-class super heavy battleships. After the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, the Imperial Japanese Navy ordered the ship's unfinished hull (45% construction completed) converted into an aircraft carrier. The Shinano featured the heaviest anti aircraft armament of all IJN carriers, heavy armor protection and was the very first carrier of the IJN to have a full amored flight deck, thanks to its Yamato-class legacy. The Shinano-class carried a huge air group of 120 aircrafts. The Imperial Japanese Navy decided that carriers of the heavily armored Shinano class would either serve as a support carrier or floating battle fortress at the frontline for the Combined Fleets battle line."

The IJN Taihō ("Great Phoenix") was approved for construction in the 1939 4th Supplementary Programme. Her design was that of a modified Shōkaku with slightly reduced speed but stronger hull and armor protection. Under the Modified Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942, Taihō was to be the first of a new generation of Japanese aircraft carriers featuring a amored flight deck and better overall armor protection against dive bombers and was expected to not only survive multiple bomb, torpedo, or shell hits, but also continue fighting effectively afterwards. Also the anti aircraft armement was significantly increased. After the launch of the IJN Taiho, it became almost immideatly the flagship of the Combined Fleet."

Both ships of the class, Hiyō ("Flying Hawk") and Jun'yō ("Peregrine Falcon"), were originally laid down as luxury passenger liners before being acquired by the IJN for conversion to aircraft carriers in 1941. Their air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M "Claude" fighters, plus 4 in storage, 18 Aichi D3A "Val" dive bombers, with an additional 2 in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N "Kate" torpedo bombers.

In the lead-up to the Pacific War the Imperial Japanese Navy attempted to build a large number of fleet carriers, in fact 16. The lead ship was IJN Unryū ("Cloud Dragon") For them to be built quickly, the design for these ships was based on the aircraft carrier Hiryū rather than the newer and more sophisticated Taihō or the Shōkaku class. The Unryū-class aircraft carrier design was very similar to that of Hiryū. The ships were lightly built, and the main difference from Hiryū was that the carriers' island was placed on the starboard side of the ships. The carriers were capable of carrying 63 aircraft in two hangars, and were fitted with two elevators."
