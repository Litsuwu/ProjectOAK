#Changelog since 3.7.17

#3.7.17 3 PM EST update:
#	New GFX for several leaders in Central Asia and some in Baltic States (whatever is missing from here will be in by tomorrow)
#	New GFX for JAP / ENG ships, some USA armor, JAP air tree
#	Considerable number of new states added – most are in Austria and Yugoslavia (to simulate historical occupations of these areas), but also added the Siliguri Corridor in India. Revised events like Anschluss and the Fate of Yugoslavia accordingly to implement new states
#	Huge number of strategic regions added with appropriate weather – much easier to micromanage planes. Attempted to target all very large air regions, added proper localization for all of these.
#	Japanese specialized factories should now give proper bonuses
#	Minor reworks to factory efficiency / production output
#	Some air stat rebalancing, but very minor
#	Increased cost and manpower of generic tree destroyers slightly
#	Changed some event mentions from “controls_state =” to “has_full_control_of_state =” to avoid weird niche event firing situations
#	A few more errors with duplicate gfx were removed
#3.7.17 8 PM EST update:
#	Added releasable Balkan countries of Slovenia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, & Macedonia (FYROM)
#	Revised a few errors with new strategic regions, states, OOBs, etc. 
#	CV aircraft balancing, nothing major here I believe
#	Continued work on American air tree, though it is still not enabled – balance issues
#	Fixed issue with Pressure Siam national focus that would do nothing when fired
#	Added GFX for some ships for JAP
#3.8.17 3 PM EST update:
#	US air tree enabled & rebalanced from vanilla BICE – generally speaking we pared in some of the weird-looking values and made some minor changes to fighter air attack; balancing is a work in progress and if you notice anything weird, say something in the bug reports or in mod workshop
#	Made some US divisions start under-strength to reflect their use as reserve prior to game period
#	Added US airplanes to unique air factories and to aircraft manufacturers

#3.8.17 9 PM EST update:
#	Due to severe crashing issues around 1940 we rolled back state changes temporarily and are in the process of determining the issue
#	Begun to add resources per historical records; added 10 oil to Burma and 4 to Taiwan, added 5 aluminum (bauxite) to Palau
#
#3.9.17 4 PM EST update:
#	Small fixes in localization (typos)
#	Fixed issue where Brazil would still join Chinese United Front
#
#3.9.17 5 PM EST update:
#	Re-enabled new strategic regions and states, with no stability issues
#3.10.17 9 PM EST update:
#	Resolved serious error where pathfinding to state 463 (Alaska) was incorrect and would cause a crash if any Pacific nation justified on USA
#	Minor bugfixes
#3.12.17 3PM EST update:
#	Resolved serious multiplayer desyncing error caused by shared unique technologies
#3.12.17 8 PM EST update:
#	Added 3 new states in northern China (Inner Mongolia), revised resources and cores somewhat
#	Made Nationalist China more willing to build any divisions other than militia, and removed a bug that made them disband all the divisions they spawned with which started outside of their nominally controlled territory
#	Added a changelog within game files, in case people prefer looking at that one
#	Made some minor fixes to puppet names, and added historical Japanese puppet names for the Chinese government
#	Laid base for new German air NFs
#3.14.17 8 PM EST update:
#	Added 57 states and a few strategic regions, most of which are in Southeast Asia – the province resources were rebalanced in this region and cores for minors, like Shan, Mon, Rakhine, Kachin, Laos, Lanna, etc. are coming. Added a few states in Kashmir as well
#	Fixed a minor glitch where lake Constance still belonged to Wurttemburg state, rather than not being part of any state
#	Attempted to improve Italy AI outcomes – they should not join the war until a little later in 1940, and hopefully not until after France falls, as was the case historically
#	Increased minimum coverage for an air mission to be considered, from 20% to 40%
#	Decreased plan_value_to_execute from -0.62 to -0.72, hopefully making front slightly more static
#	AI_front_movement_factor_for_ready increased from 0.25 to 0.45, meaning that more of the front must not be moving for an attack to be made
#	Minimum and maximum AI fleet size both increased, from 5 and 40 to 7 and 45
#	AI air updates slightly less (6 days vs 4 days)
#	Begun rework of German NF focus tree – if you see an event firing at the wrong time, or an invasion happening at the wrong time let us know so we can fix it
#	Added in German air NF tree
#	Made ENG AI less focused on Europe and Africa (ai_strategy from 200 to 100 for both) and gave it a 100 value mission to protect EGY
#	After 15% surrender progress, decreased ENG’s tendency to run back to Europe slightly
#	Added additional theorist slot and some theorists for a few countries

#	Added a bunch of generals to Siam, with appropriate portraits and skills / skill level
#	Danzig or War will fire on the correct date now (September 1 1939)
#	Changed some localization of fascist and communist countries – most common examples will be Vichy now being “French State” and Francoist regime being “Spanish State”, but some other ones also. Find them if you go ahistorical!
